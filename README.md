WEB120 Portal Webpage for Spring 2018

02/03/2022

This was a portal website for a class that I took at Seattle Central College. It is a basic navbar with some small essays about wireframes and understanding your client. It has an email configuration. I wanted to see if I could recreate the config files necessary so that anyone could clone it off Github and run it, but it's way too elaborate. In general, the config files included a Recaptcha and Email keys, as well as some more PHP that made the portal website work. I'll leave the code out there, since it's likely sound, but there's no sincere way for anyone to clone this project and run it locally, but I do have the temperature converter program out there if you're very interested on getting a PHP project to run locally on your Windows machine.
