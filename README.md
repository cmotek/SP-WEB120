As part of my Github Cleanup, I decided to go over some old projects and see if I could restart them and get them working on my PC. I cloned this repository and got PHP installed on my PC, but it's going to take a little work to see if I can recreate the necessary config files in order to run the project on a local browser. It will be a fun little challenge. 

Anyways, first steps:

- Clone Repository
- Install PHP for Windows, Mac, or Linux if you do not have it already on your computer

I was able to get XAMPP running on my computer, but there is no way to run this project with the config files that are gitignored out of the project files. I wonder if I could build a Github Action to build the config files once the project is cloned off Github. I'll have to do some research and review the original project to see if I can do that.
