As part of my Github Cleanup, I decided to go over some old projects and see if I could restart them and get them working on my PC. I cloned this repository and got PHP installed on my PC, but it's going to take a little work to see if I can recreate the necessary config files in order to run the project on a local browser. It will be a fun little challenge. 

Anyways, first steps:

- Clone Repository
- Install PHP for Windows, Mac, or Linux if you do not have it already on your computer
